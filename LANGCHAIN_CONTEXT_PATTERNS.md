# LangChain Context-Aware Agent Patterns for MIT Tracking

## Overview

This document outlines advanced LangChain memory management patterns researched in 2025 and how they can be integrated into our MIT Tracking logistics intelligence platform to create more sophisticated, context-aware agents.

## Current Implementation vs. LangChain Patterns

### Our Current System âœ…
- **Short-term Context**: Session-based context storage (8-hour expiration)
- **User Context**: General user preferences and long-term data
- **Global Context**: System and company-wide knowledge
- **Document Linking**: Connect documents to context via orders/journeys
- **Embedding Storage**: Semantic search with sentence-transformers

### LangChain 2025 Patterns to Implement ðŸš€

## 1. Enhanced Memory Architecture

### Core Memory Types

**Thread-Scoped Memory (Short-term)**
- âœ… Already implemented as `SHORT_TERM` context
- ðŸ”„ **Enhancement**: Add conversation compression for long sessions
- ðŸ”„ **Enhancement**: Implement context window optimization

**Persistent Memory (Long-term)**
- âœ… Already implemented as `GENERAL` context  
- ðŸš€ **New**: Add episodic memory for specific interactions
- ðŸš€ **New**: Add procedural memory for recurring task patterns
- ðŸš€ **New**: Add semantic memory for domain knowledge

### Implementation Strategy

```python
# Enhanced Context Types
class ContextType(str, Enum):
    SHORT_TERM = "SHORT_TERM"          # Current session (existing)
    GENERAL = "GENERAL"                # User preferences (existing)
    EPISODIC = "EPISODIC"             # Specific events/interactions
    PROCEDURAL = "PROCEDURAL"         # Task patterns and workflows
    SEMANTIC = "SEMANTIC"             # Domain knowledge
    SYSTEM = "SYSTEM"                 # System-wide knowledge (existing)
    COMPANY = "COMPANY"               # Company-wide data (existing)

# Memory Scope Expansion
class MemoryScope(str, Enum):
    SESSION = "SESSION"               # Current conversation
    USER = "USER"                     # User-specific across sessions
    ORDER = "ORDER"                   # Order/journey-specific
    CLIENT = "CLIENT"                 # Client-specific patterns
    DOMAIN = "DOMAIN"                 # Logistics domain knowledge
```

## 2. Context Engineering Patterns

### Pattern 1: Writing Context (Information Extraction)
**Current**: Manual context creation
**Enhancement**: Automatic context extraction from conversations

```python
class ContextExtractor:
    """Extract and categorize information from conversations"""
    
    async def extract_episodic_memories(self, conversation_history):
        """Extract specific events: shipment issues, client preferences, etc."""
        pass
    
    async def extract_procedural_patterns(self, user_actions):
        """Learn user workflows: document handling, query patterns, etc."""
        pass
    
    async def extract_semantic_knowledge(self, document_content):
        """Build domain knowledge from processed documents"""
        pass
```

### Pattern 2: Selecting Context (Smart Retrieval)
**Current**: Basic context merging
**Enhancement**: Intelligent context selection based on relevance

```python
class ContextSelector:
    """Smart context retrieval based on conversation state"""
    
    async def select_relevant_contexts(self, query, available_contexts):
        """Use embedding similarity to select most relevant contexts"""
        embeddings = await self.embedding_service.batch_embed([
            query,
            *[ctx.content for ctx in available_contexts]
        ])
        
        similarities = compute_cosine_similarity(embeddings[0], embeddings[1:])
        return select_top_k_contexts(available_contexts, similarities, k=5)
```

### Pattern 3: Compressing Context (Token Optimization)
**Current**: Full context loading
**Enhancement**: Context summarization and compression

```python
class ContextCompressor:
    """Optimize context for token efficiency"""
    
    async def compress_conversation_history(self, messages, max_tokens=2000):
        """Summarize long conversations while preserving key information"""
        pass
    
    async def compress_document_context(self, documents, relevance_threshold=0.7):
        """Include only most relevant document excerpts"""
        pass
```

### Pattern 4: Isolating Context (Modular Memory)
**Current**: Monolithic context objects
**Enhancement**: Specialized memory modules

```python
class SpecializedMemoryModules:
    """Isolated memory systems for different types of information"""
    
    logistics_memory: LogisticsKnowledgeBase
    client_interaction_memory: ClientPatternTracker  
    document_processing_memory: DocumentWorkflowTracker
    incident_memory: IncidentPatternAnalyzer
```

## 3. Advanced Features Implementation

### LangMem SDK-Inspired Pattern
```python
class AgentOptimizer:
    """Analyze agent performance and optimize behavior"""
    
    async def analyze_interaction_success(self, conversation_id):
        """Determine if interaction was successful based on user feedback"""
        pass
    
    async def update_system_prompts(self, successful_patterns):
        """Reinforce effective behaviors in agent instructions"""
        pass
    
    async def identify_knowledge_gaps(self, failed_interactions):
        """Find areas where agent needs more information"""
        pass
```

### MongoDB Store Integration
```python
class PersistentMemoryStore:
    """Long-term memory storage using MongoDB collections"""
    
    episodic_memories: Collection  # Specific events and interactions
    procedural_patterns: Collection  # Learned workflows
    semantic_knowledge: Collection  # Domain expertise
    user_preferences: Collection  # Personalization data
    
    async def store_cross_session_memory(self, user_id, memory_type, content):
        """Store memories that persist across sessions"""
        pass
    
    async def retrieve_relevant_memories(self, query_embedding, memory_types):
        """Vector search across memory types"""
        pass
```

        self.memory_manager = EnhancedMemoryManager()
        self.context_selector = ContextSelector()
        self.optimizer = AgentOptimizer()
    
    async def process_query(self, query, session_id):
        # 1. Select relevant context
        relevant_contexts = await self.context_selector.select_relevant_contexts(
            query, session_id
        )
        
        # 2. Compress context if needed
        optimized_context = await self.compress_context_if_needed(relevant_contexts)
        
        # 3. Generate response with enhanced context
        response = await self.generate_response(query, optimized_context)
        
        # 4. Extract and store new memories
        await self.memory_manager.extract_and_store_memories(
            query, response, session_id
        )
        
        # 5. Update agent behavior based on success
        await self.optimizer.track_interaction(query, response, session_id)
        
        return response
```

- Memory sharing controls between users

## Conclusion

Implementing these LangChain 2025 patterns will transform our MIT Tracking system from a reactive document processing platform into a proactive, learning logistics intelligence assistant. The enhanced memory architecture will enable agents to:

1. **Remember and learn** from each interaction
2. **Build domain expertise** automatically from document processing
3. **Personalize responses** based on user and company patterns
4. **Optimize performance** through continuous learning

The modular implementation approach ensures we can adopt these patterns incrementally while maintaining system stability and performance.
